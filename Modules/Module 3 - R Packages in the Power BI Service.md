You can use the powerful [R programming
language](https://www.r-project.org/) to create visuals in the Power BI
service. Many R packages are supported in the Power BI service (and more
are being supported all the time), and some packages are not.

The following sections provide an alphabetical table of which R packages
are supported in Power BI, and which are not. For more information about
R in Power BI, see the [R
visuals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/service-r-visuals)
article.

Request support for a new R package

Supported R packages for the **Power BI service** are found in the
following section, titled **Supported Packages**. If you would like to
request support of an R package not found in that list, you can send an
email with your request to the [R in Power BI Feedback
Team](mailto:rinpbifb@microsoft.com).

Requirements and Limitations of R packages

There are a handful of requirements and limitations for R packages:

-   The Power BI service, for the most part, supports R packages with
    free and open-source software licenses such as GPL-2, GPL-3, MIT+,
    and so on.

-   The Power BI service supports packages published in CRAN. The
    service does not support private or custom R packages. Users are
    encouraged to make their private packages available on CRAN prior to
    requesting the package be available in the Power BI service.

-   The **Power BI Desktop** has two variations for R packages:

    -   For R visuals, you can install any package, including custom R
        packages

    -   For Custom R visuals, only public CRAN packages are supported
        for auto-installation of the packages

-   For security and privacy reasons, R packages that provide
    client-server queries over the World-Wide Web (such as RgoogleMaps)
    in the service, are not supported. Networking is blocked for such
    attempts. See the following section for a list of supported and
    unsupported R packages.

-   The approval process for including a new R package has a tree of
    dependencies; some dependencies required to be installed in the
    service cannot be supported.

The following table shows which packages **are supported** in the Power
BI service.
